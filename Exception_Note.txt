Points to Remember :
-------------------------
1. Use the try, catch and finally blocks to handle exceptions in C#.
2. The try block must be followed by a catch or finally block or both.
3. A multiple catch block is allowed with different exception filters. General catch{..} block must come last.
4. catch{..} and catch(Exception ex){ } both cannot be used.
5. The finally block must come after the try or catch block.
6. The finally block will always execute irrespective of whether an exception occured or not.
7. The finally block is appropriate place for disposing objects.
8. The finally block cannot have a return or break because it isn't allow to leave the control.
9. Nested try-catch blocks are allowed in C#.
10. An Exception will be catched in the inner catch block if appropriate filter found, otherwise will be catched by outer catch block.


C# - throw keyword:
We have seen in the previous section how to handle exceptions which are automatically raised by CLR.
 Here, we will see how to raise an exception manually.

An exception can be raised manually by using the throw keyword.
 Any type of exceptions which is derived from Exception class can be raised using the throw keyword.
